🔐 Network Packet Analyzer (Python)

A Python-based Network Packet Analyzer developed for educational purposes to understand how data packets travel across a network in real time.
The tool captures and analyzes live network traffic and presents key packet details through a graphical user interface (GUI).

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates practical knowledge of networking fundamentals and packet-level analysis.
It integrates a backend packet sniffer with a frontend GUI, allowing users to start and stop packet capture using a single command.

⚙️ Features

Live network packet sniffing

Displays source and destination IP addresses

Protocol identification (TCP / UDP / Others)

Timestamped packet logging

Packet counter

GUI-based visualization

Single-file execution (backend + frontend together)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Scapy – for packet sniffing and protocol analysis

Tkinter – for GUI development

Threading – to keep GUI responsive during sniffing

🖥️ GUI Preview

The graphical interface provides:

Start / Stop sniffing buttons

Live packet table

Packet counter

Sniffing status indicator
